# cool-python-console-app
a simple app that has you type in words or word and turns it into its hashed form, there is several hasing types that you can choose from. you can also make or remove a file, and also shutdown your computer. its random but i created it out of bordom 

this program was written on mac os, if it does not work on windows let me know.

to run the python script open terminal an type "python" then the path to the file.




(example)
    python /users/bob/desktop/hash.pyit will be different for you, unless yur name is bob and you saved the file on your desktop lol.
